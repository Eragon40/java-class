#+TITLE: Java Class: Week 1 (20 June)

* Intro
*** Review last class: binary numbers, bitwise operations
*** Goals for this class
* Why program?
*** Need to solve a problem
- compute the average of a lot of numbers
- suggest spelling corrections to a person
- schedule routes for delivery trucks
*** Computer scientists devise algorithms to solve these problems
***** Algorithm: like a recipe                             :exercise:
* What is programming
In an important sense, programming is the translation of an algorithm into
instructions for a computer to follow.
*** But computers operate using bits?
*** Languages allow control at a higher level
- Machine code: bits
- Assembly: mnemonics
- High-level languages: blocks
*** Language has syntax and semantics                               :example:
* What is Java
*** Bytecode compiler -- translates high-level syntax to machine code
***** Runs on a "virtual machine"
The virtual machine allows a single Java program to run on lots of different
underlying hardware architectures (e.g., phones, desktops, mainframes).
*** Statically typed
*** Garbage-collected
Memory is managed for you by the virtual machine.
*** Object-oriented
Code is grouped into logical "objects" that combine data with functions for
manipulating the data.
* First example program
public class Hello {
    public static int main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, world!");
    }
}
* Writing output
***** order of operations                                          :exercise:
* Strings
*** represent sequences of characters
*** enclosed in double quotes
*** display messages to user of program
*** System.out.println
*** escaping
*** How many characters are printed?

"hello world!"
"\""
"\\'\\\\\""
"\n"
" here  we  are"
